# Titanic_Accident_Data_Analysis
Data analysis of the Titanic dataset: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and survival insights using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

This repository contains an **end-to-end data analysis project** based on the famous Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to explore the data, clean and preprocess it, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncover insights about the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Import & Exploration**
   - Load Titanic dataset
   - Understand data structure and features

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates
   - Correct data types

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features
   - Encode categorical variables

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Survival by age, gender, class, and embarkation
   - Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

5. **Insights**
   - Female passengers had higher survival rates
   - Higher class (1st class) passengers were more likely to survive
   - Age distribution impacted survival chances
